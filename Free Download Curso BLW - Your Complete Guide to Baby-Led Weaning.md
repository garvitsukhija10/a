## What is Baby-Led Weaning (BLW)?

*   **Encourages exploration:** Babies get to experience different textures and tastes.
*   **Develops fine motor skills:** Grasping and bringing food to their mouths enhances coordination.
*   **Promotes independence:** Babies learn to self-regulate their intake.
*   **Family meals:** Easier integration into family meals as babies eat the same foods (modified for safety, of course).

This Curso BLW will walk you through every aspect, from understanding readiness cues to preventing choking hazards.
