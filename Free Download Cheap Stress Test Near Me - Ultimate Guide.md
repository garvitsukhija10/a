The typical procedures involved in a stress test include:

*   **Monitoring:** Your heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG are constantly monitored.
*   **Exercise:** You'll typically walk on a treadmill or pedal on a stationary bike, with the intensity gradually increasing.
*   **Observation:** Doctors look for any abnormalities in your heart's electrical activity or symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath.
