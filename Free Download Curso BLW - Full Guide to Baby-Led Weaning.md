## What is Baby-Led Weaning (BLW)?

BLW is a method of introducing solid foods to babies where they feed themselves whole, soft pieces of food from the start, instead of spoon-feeding them purees. It's a fun, engaging, and nutritious way to help your baby develop healthy eating habits. Benefits of BLW include:

*   **Development of fine motor skills:** Grasping and bringing food to their mouths helps babies refine their motor skills.
*   **Exploring textures and tastes:** Introducing whole foods allows babies to experience a wider range of tastes and textures.
*   **Self-regulation:** Babies learn to listen to their own hunger cues and stop when they are full, potentially leading to healthier eating habits later in life.
*   **Family meals:** BLW encourages family meals where everyone eats together, fostering a positive relationship with food.
